Fibonacci series Implemented in Python3 using Google Colab
The two codes show two different implementation techniques to calculate the fibonacci numbers for the input "n"

Naive Algorithm: Recursive method
Efficient Algorithm : Using assignment and "for" loop to calculate and generate the series

Fun Fact : Fibonacci Numbers were originally created to model Rabbit population
